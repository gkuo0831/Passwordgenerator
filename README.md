# Passwordgenerator Assignment

In this repository, you will find my verison of an application that generates a random password based on the users choice.

When the "generate password" button is clicked, the user will be asked to chose a password length and if they want to use uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters in their password. It also won't matter what size screen this application is opened on because it has be created to fit all screen sizes.
